# ARGO_Labs
This is a repository for all my work at ARGO Labs 

The goal of this project is to, by leveraging, the segmentation and classification approach as described in the [pyimagesearch blogpost](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/03/semantic-segmentation-with-opencv-and-deep-learning), count the number of distinct objects along 2nd Avenue in Manhattan.
